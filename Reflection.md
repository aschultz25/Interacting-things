Reflect on the process learning about conditionals. It can be brief, but do so in a narrative form. Some questions you could consider.  
What was challenging for you during this process?
What makes more sense now than it did before you started?
What are you proud of?

The part of this project that was most challenging, was getting the circles to interact the way I wanted them to. In my code, you can see that they switch colors when they touch, and increase speed and change directions when they bounce off any surface. I'm satisfied with how it turned out, but originally, instead of switching colors, I wanted to have them grow in size by 1 or 2 units every time they touch along with speeding up and changing directions. Every time the balls would touch, they would stick together and very fast grow and speed up. This is because they weren't moving away from each other fast enough when changing directions, so they got stuck in a loop of changing directions back into each other very quickly and growing in size. I needed to just make the balls move quicker but when I did this, there was an error in my code that let the balls leave the canvas, which was frustrating. Eventually I decided to try a different angle and have them switch colors at every touch. I'm proud that I was eventually able to get it to work even if I had to pivot my original plan. Additionally, for the reset when key pressed function, is there a simpler or condensed way to write all that code out?
